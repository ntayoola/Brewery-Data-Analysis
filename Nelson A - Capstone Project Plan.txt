Purpose
Overarching Question:
* How can we improve the efficiency and quality of beer production to maximize sales while minimizing losses?
Hypothesis:
* Higher efficiency in the brewing process and better quality scores are positively correlated with higher sales and lower production losses.
Problem Statement:
* The brewery is facing challenges in optimizing production efficiency and maintaining high-quality beer while keeping losses during brewing, fermentation, and bottling to a minimum. This analysis aims to identify key factors that influence these outcomes and provide actionable insights to improve overall performance.
Objectives:
* Identify factors that impact the efficiency and quality of beer production.
* Determine the relationship between production efficiency, quality scores, and sales.
* Develop strategies to minimize losses during different stages of production.
Desired Outcomes:
* Improved production processes.
* Enhanced product quality.
* Increased sales.
* Reduced production losses.

Analysis
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
* Brewhouse Efficiency
* Quality Score
* Total Sales
* Losses during Brewing, Fermentation, and Bottling
Questions for Analysis:
1. What is the relationship between brewhouse efficiency and total sales?
2. How do quality scores impact total sales?
3. Which stages of production contribute most to losses, and how do these losses affect overall sales?
4. How do different beer styles perform in terms of efficiency, quality, and sales?
5. What are the regional differences in production efficiency and sales?
Process:
* Clean and preprocess the data (Excel, Python)
* Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations(Python, SQL)
* Visualize data(Python, Tableau)
* Perform statistical analyses to test hypotheses
* Develop predictive models if needed(Python, Tableau)
* Additional Calculations:
* Calculate monthly averages for sales, efficiency, and quality scores.
* Compute loss percentages for each stage of production.
Validation:
* Cross-validate models using a subset of the data.
* Compare findings with industry benchmarks.
Limitations and Assumptions:
* Assumption: Data accurately represents production processes and outcomes.
* Limitation: Missing data or inconsistencies may affect the analysis.
* Assumption: External market factors are constant and do not significantly impact sales trends.
